Matlab scripts used for an analysis comparing global reservoir storage trends from recently published satellite-derived datasets.

The four published datasets used in this analysis are:

Global Lake Water Storage (**GLWS**) - Yao, F. et al. (2023), Satellites reveal widespread decline in global lake water storage. _Science_

Global Reservoir Storage (**GRS**) - Li, Y. et al. (2023), Diminishing storage returns of reservoir construction. _Nature Communications_ 14

**GloLakes** - Hou, J. et al. (2024), Water storage dynamics for 27000 lakes globally from 1984 to present derived from satellite altimetry and optical imaging. _Earth System Science Data_ 16, 201â€“218.

Global Reservoir Deep Learning (**GRDL**) - Hao, Z. et al. (2024), GRDL: A New Global Reservoir Area-Storage-Depth Data Set Derived Through Deep Learning-Based Bathymetry Reconstruction. _Water Resources Research_
